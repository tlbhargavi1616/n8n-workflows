# n8n Automation Workflows 🚀

This repository showcases my hands-on learning and practical implementation of **workflow automation using n8n**, with a strong focus on **API integrations, conditional logic, debugging, and version control**.
## 🧪 Day 01 – Automation Foundations

### Objective
To understand and implement the **core building blocks of automation workflows** using n8n.

### Concepts Implemented
- Manual Trigger (controlled execution)
- Edit Fields (data creation and transformation)
- IF Node (conditional branching)
- HTTP Request Node (real REST API integration)
- Execution data analysis & debugging
- Workflow export and Git versioning

### Workflow Summary
- Generates a **Hello World** message
- Applies **conditional logic** using an IF node
- Triggers an external API call (`GET https://httpbin.org/get`) when the condition evaluates to true
- Demonstrates deterministic workflow behavior

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **n8n** – Workflow automation
- **REST APIs** – Integration & data exchange
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration
- **HTTP methods** – GET, POST (upcoming)

---

## 🔍 Engineering Practices Followed
- Deterministic workflow design
- Clear data flow between nodes
- Node-level debugging using execution data
- Version-controlled workflow exports
- Separation of logic and credentials
